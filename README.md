# About Me
Hi, my name is Gil Glick, and I am currently a 2nd year at Northeastern University living in Boston. I am interested in the thought process of solving difficult small problems, and how different parts of code connect to create a large project. Some hobbies of mine include cooking, baking, and learning about geography and history. 

## Notable Projects 🛠️
Sokoban: Created a 2D board puzzle game, with mechanics such as moveable blocks, and color-coded trophies and targets.    
Maze Game: Used the Kruskal's algorithm to create a randomly generated maze.
